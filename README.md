# SentimentAnalysis_Results
I am uploading the results of the sentiment analysis that was conducted in 2021. The raw tweets went missing, as I am enclosing the data a few years later. 
The following are the contents of the file: 
1. Positiveword.txt - which includes the words that are listed as positive for the algorithm
2. Negativewords.txt - contains all the negative words.
3. Results of sentiment analysis during Taliban Takeover in Afghanistan - which covers the reaction of 4000 tweets extracted while the Taliban took control of Afghanistan.
4. People's reaction (extracted from Twitter) when the Pakistani Government supported the Taliban in establishing a proper Government in Afghanistan.
5. Sentiment analysis results in Kerala (a south Indian state) before the COVID-19 third wave (and after the second wave, while lockdown was eased).
6. Sentiment analysis results in Kerala (a south Indian state) during the COVID-19 third wave (while lockdown was strengthened again).
7. Sentiment analysis results in Tamil Nadu (a south Indian state) before the COVID-19 third wave (and after the second wave, while lockdown was eased).
6. Sentiment analysis results in Tamil Nadu (a south Indian state) during the COVID-19 third wave (while the lockdown was strengthened again).


The analysis was conducted using R by extracting tweets using the twitteR package. The raw tweets were lost since I uploaded the results two years later after the analysis was made. Viewers can make use of the results I uploaded to understand the people's sentiments during the time of a crisis.
