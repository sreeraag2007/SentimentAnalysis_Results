I am uploading the results of the sentiment analysis that was conducted in 2021. The raw tweets went missing, as I am enclosing the data a few years later. 
The following are the contents of the file: 
1. Positiveword.txt - which includes the words that are listed as positive for the algorithm
2. Negativewords.txt - contains all the negative words.
3. Results of sentiment analysis during Taliban Takeover in Afghanistan. It comprises two folders - one which covers the reaction of 4000 tweets extracted while the Taliban took control of Afghanistan. The other folder contains the people's reaction (extracted from Twitter) when the Pakistani Government supported the Taliban in establishing a proper Government in Afghanistan.
4. Sentiment analysis results for Kerala and Tamil Nadu - the two states in India - before the third COVID-19 wave (and after the second wave).
5. The sentiment analysis results for Kerala and Tamil Nadu during the third COVID-19 wave in India.
