Hu and Liu's Opinion Lexicon, also known as Sentiment Lexicon, performs the sentimental analysis and divides about 6800 words into positive and negative categories. 
This includes linguistic differences based on location, misspelled words, and markup on social media. They then annotate the tweets with their sentiment. A
bar chart is then created using the emotional score data.  Targets in opinion mining are the entities and traits that constitute the basis for the opinion. 
There are several grammatical connections between the opinion words and the tasks' objectives. 
These relations are found using a dependency parser, which is then applied to enlarge the original opinion lexicon for target extraction.
Additionally, because the relationship between opinion words and targets is propagated, the approach is semi-supervised.
